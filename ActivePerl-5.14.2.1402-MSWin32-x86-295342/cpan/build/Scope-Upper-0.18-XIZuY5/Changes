Revision history for Scope-Upper

0.18    2011-10-10 20:50 UTC
        + Add : The uid() function returns an unique identifier for each dynamic
                scope. The validate_uid() function can be used to check whether
                one such identifier is valid (i.e. that the scope it refers to
                is still alive).
        + Chg : It is no longer possible on perl 5.6 to call goto() in an
                uplevel callback to replace the uplevel call. This change was
                needed in order to ensure consistency between platforms
                regarding to the following fix just below.
        + Fix : The uplevel() tests now pass on Windows.
                Thanks C.H. Kang for bringing this to my attention.

0.17    2011-10-03 21:45 UTC
        + Fix : uplevel() will now use the correct pad when executing its
                callback. This fixes at least two issues :
                - closures defined inside the uplevel callback can now correctly
                access lexicals from inside and outside the callback.
                - state variables in the uplevel callback now work properly.
        + Fix : It is now generally possible to call goto() in the uplevel'd
                code to replace the uplevel stack frame. There are two cases
                for which it is still not possible :
                - if -D flags were set when running perl (as in "perl -Dt ...").
                - if the perl runloop has been replaced with a custom one by
                another module.
                If uplevel() detects that the replacement code contains a goto
                statement, and is in one of those two cases, then it will refuse
                to execute the callback and throw an exception.
                Note that this fix implies a run-time overhead of uplevel()
                proportional to the size of the the callback in every case
                (with a small ratio), and proportional to the size of ALL the
                code executed as the result of the uplevel call (including
                subroutine calls inside the callback) when a goto statement is
                found in the uplevel callback.
        + Fix : uplevel() has been taught how to handle XS callbacks properly.
        + Fix : The cause of "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar" warnings
                when using uplevel() has been addressed.
        + Fix : [RT #71212] : build failure on Windows.
                The module does no longer rely on calling Perl_cv_clone, which
                isn't exported.
                Thanks C.H. Kang for reporting.

0.16    2011-09-03 23:00 UTC
        + Add : uplevel($code, @args, $cxt) executes $code with arguments @args
                in the upper context pointed by $cxt.
                This is an XS version of the well-known uplevel() routine from
                Sub::Uplevel. There are a few differences between both
                implmentations that are listed in the documentation.
                The XS version is roughly 10 times faster than the pure-Perl
                version.

0.15    2011-08-24 14:20 UTC
        + Fix : Localizing subroutines in an higher scope will now correctly
                update the method cache.

0.14    2011-02-27 00:00 UTC
        + Fix : [RT #64997] : Compatibility with perl 5.13.10.
                Thanks Dave Mitchell for the notice.
        + Tst : Lengthy tests have been ported to Test::Leaner, making the
                whole test suite about 50% faster.

0.13    2010-12-20 01:00 UTC
        + Fix : [RT #61904] : Stack corruption when using unwind() under
                Devel::NYTProf.
                Thanks Sergey Aleynikov for contributing a fix.
        + Fix : [RT #63378] : Compatibility with perl 5.13.8.
                Thanks Andreas J. König for bisecting the issue.
        + Tst : Threads tests are now only run on perl 5.13.4 and higher.
                They could segfault randomly because of what seems to be an
                internal bug of Perl, which has been addressed in 5.13.4.
                There is also an environment variable that allows you to
                forcefully run those tests, but it should be set only for
                author testing and not for end users.

0.12    2010-05-19 00:45 UTC
        + Fix : Compatibility with perl 5.13.
        + Fix : Test failures with perl 5.8.0.
        + Fix : A minor leak of SVs when a non array/hash was passed to
                localize_elem().

0.11    2010-04-16 23:20 UTC
        + Chg : It's now forbiddent to pass a reference to a non-glob variable
                as the localization target of localize(), localize_elem() and
                localize_delete().
        + Chg : localize_elem() now only accepts localization of arrays or hashs
                elements. For other types, it used to be a synonym of localize.
        + Chg : localize_elem() no longer accepts a glob as the target. You now
                have to specify the variable as a string. This is because it was
                impossible in this case to handle meaningfully the array or the
                hash reference passed as the assigned value.
        + Doc : The synopsys was revamped, and the rest of the documentation was
                reviewed.
        + Fix : [RT #55593] : Segfault when localizing hash or array element to
                different package in different file.
                Thanks Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker for reporting.
        + Fix : [RT #56301] : reap loses eval context when dying naturally.
                Thanks Andrew Main for reporting.
        + Fix : Scope inconsistencies and segfaults when saving several
                localizations into the same target scope.
        + Fix : Stop skipping frames as a pop optimization. This caused breakage
                under the debugger (and most likely outside as well).

0.10    2010-01-18 23:50 UTC
        + Fix : Properly handle given/when on 5.10.
        + Fix : Some stack inconsistencies were fixed, though they were unlikely
                to have an impact on your real-life code.
        + Fix : Work around Kwalitee test misfailures.

0.09    2009-05-17 20:20 UTC
        + Add : The new SU_THREADSAFE constant can be used to know whether the
                module could have been built with thread safety enabled.
        + Chg : Thread safety is disabled for perl 5.8 on Win32.
        + Chg : A saner workaround for the "call_sv() during LEAVE clobbers the
                still used last popped stack element" issue on 5.10.

0.08    2009-04-16 22:50 UTC
        + Fix : [RT #44204] : Stack corruption with reap(). Thanks Torsten
                Foertsch for reporting.
        + Fix : Building with Solaris CC.
        + Tst : unwind() in threads.

0.07    2009-02-20 00:20 UTC
        + Chg : The CLONE method will no longer be defined for non-threaded
                perls.
        + Doc : Some examples on how to build the target context from the words.
        + Fix : Some unlikely possible uninitialized reads, indirectly pointed
                out in a Redhat review request.
        + Fix : "localize *x, 'y' => $cxt" now matches Perl's behaviour for
                "local *x = 'y'".
        + Fix : Miscellanous code cleanups, courtesy of Florian Ragwitz.
        + Upd : Resources in META.yml.

0.06    2009-01-17 00:05 UTC
        + Chg : INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The level is now absolute and no longer
                relative to the current frame - we'll call it "context" from now
                on. You should replace all your raw levels by combinations of
                words.
                The old behaviour of "=> $n" can be easily reobtained by using
                "=> SCOPE($n)".
        + Fix : As a result of this change, the module now plays nicely with
                the debugger.

0.05    2009-01-12 18:15 UTC
        + Fix : Stack mess when using unwind() in scalar context.
        + Fix : Returning an automatic variable isn't wise, so let's use a
                context instead.
        + Doc : Clarifications.
        + Tst : Stress tests for unwind().

0.04    2009-01-11 18:40 UTC
        + Add : unwind(@things, $level), that returns to an upper context.
        + Add : want_at($level), that gives the wantarray for $level.
        + Add : Control words, to reliably get the level of the n-th upper
                subroutine or eval scope. TOPLEVEL was renamed to TOP.
        + Fix : Tests with 5.6.
        + Tst : Reordering and factoring some of the stress tests so that they
                aren't needlessly ran several times.

0.03    2009-01-04 15:55 UTC
        + Add : localize_delete(), that localize array/hash elements in upper
                scopes.
        + Fix : Segfault when localizing array elements with an invalid negative
                index.

0.02    2008-12-28 18:40 UTC
        + Doc : Clarifications and improvements.
        + Fix : Missing compatibility macros.
        + Fix : Localized nonexistant array elements should be deleted when
                their time comes so that the array recovers its original length.

0.01    2008-12-26 16:05 UTC
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
