        - Stop pretending the created classes are anonymous.
          They used to close over their own metaclass, so they were never
          cleaned up anyway and only made debugging unnecessarily hard as
          all instances referenced the metaclass as well.
        - Require newer version of MX::Role::Parameterized in the parameterized
          role test. (RT#49873).

        - Allow you to pass traits => 'OneTrait' rather than having to say
          traits => ['OneTrait'] to help when getting traits from things that
