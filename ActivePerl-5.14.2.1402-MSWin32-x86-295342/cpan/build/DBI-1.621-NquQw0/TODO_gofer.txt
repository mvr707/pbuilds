Gofer TODOs:

DBD::Gofer and http transport changes
add comparisons with other proxies to gofer docs (see notes)
    http://code.google.com/p/mod-ndb/
    http://code.nytimes.com/projects/dbslayer
update gofer pdf in distribution
talk about multiple statements in single sql for gofer
inbalance between two calls to _store_response_in_cache
    - the call in transmit_request doesn't have the response_needs_retransmit logic

Add server-side caching.
    combine these:
        my $request = $transport->thaw_request( $frozen_request, $serializer );
        my $response = $executor->execute_request( $request );
        my $frozen_response = $transport->freeze_response($response, $serializer);
    into single method that first checks the cache and updates it if appropriate.
    Different serializations will have different caches

Add DBI::Gofer::Serialiser::MIME / Base64
Add DBI::Gofer::Serialiser::JSON

Gofer - allow dbh attrib changes after connect?
    note them and pass in request as STORE method calls
    but then gofer server need to reset them to restore dbh to original state
    Or, change the attr in the connect() call, but that risks
    bloating the number of cache dbh in the server.
Gofer request flags for:
    - return current executor stats as an attribute - handy for tests
    - will accept streamed resultsets
Add attr-passthru to prepare()? ie for gofer cache control & ReadOnly
Define and document termind that first checks the cache and updates it if appropriate.

Define and document terminology for client and server ends
Document user/passwd issues at the various levels of the gofer stack
    Remove "Password" from connect attr if the same as $password arg
Extract policy settings by parsing the pod
Policy for dbh attr FETCH (ie example_driver_path)
    or piggyback on skip_connect_check
    could also remember which attr have been returned to us
    so not bother FETCHing them (unless pedantic)
Call method on transport failure so transport can cleanup/reset if it wants
Gofer: gearman - need to disable coallesing for non-idempotent requests
