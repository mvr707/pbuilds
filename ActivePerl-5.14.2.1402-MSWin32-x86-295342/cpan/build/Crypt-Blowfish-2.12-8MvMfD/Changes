Revision history for Perl extension Crypt::Blowfish.

	- updated Changes to mesh with revision.

2.11  Feb 2010

2.10  Fri Dec 02 07:36:18 EST 2005
	- updated the README file to remove the reference

	  results for G4/1.2GHz PPC Mac OS X 10.4.X

2.09  Tue Nov 13 01:28:26 EST 2001
	- changed keysize back to 0
	  apparently setting keysize to 8 triggered a bad hack
	  in Crypt::CBC which resulted in OpenSRS breaking.
	  the "bad hack" in question is:
	  $ks = $cipher =~ /blowfish/i ? 56 : 8 unless $ks > 0;
	  ... anyway.. fixed.

2.08  Tue Oct 30 23:29:25 EST 2001
	- added two new functions:  min_keysize and max_keysize

	  to use variable key lengths with CBC modes.
